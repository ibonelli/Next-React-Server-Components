This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Example code

This code goes along with weKnow's article [React Server components (in a Next.js application)]() which tries to show React Server Component within Next.js 14 and compare it to React Client Component.

## Running

Next.js v14 requires Node.js version v18.17.0 or above. So you'll need to have it install. In my case I use NVM and added an `.nvmrc` file, so you can simply run `nvm use` and things should get straighten out.

To run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
